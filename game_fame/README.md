## Overview
The Game of Fame is a fast-paced, two-player competitive game where players navigate a map, overcoming obstacles and each other to claim fame points. The player with the most fame points at the end of the timer wins the game!

## How to Play
- **Players:** 2
- **Controls:**
  - **Player 1:** Uses `WASD` to move.
  - **Player 2:** Uses arrow keys to move.
- **Objective:**
  1. Players spawn on opposite sides of the map.
  2. They must reach the other side while avoiding obstacles and the opponent.
  3. Upon reaching the target, they earn a **Fame Point**.
  4. After earning a Fame Point, players must return to their starting area.
  5. The player with the most Fame Points when time runs out is the winner.

## Obstacles
The map contains various obstacles that challenge the players' ability to reach the target efficiently:
- **Walls** – Block movement, requiring players to navigate around them.
- **Moving Barriers** – Periodically shift positions, forcing players to time their movements.
- **Traps** – Temporarily slow down players who step on them.
- **Teleporters** – Instantly move players to a different location on the map.
- **The Opponent** – Players can block each other, making strategic positioning important.

## The Learning Mechanic: Basic Addition
To make the game educational, we've integrated basic single-digit addition into an important mechanic:
- **Unlocking Fame Points:** When a player reaches the target, they must solve multiple simple addition problems (e.g., `7 + 2 = ?`) to claim the Fame Point.
- **Teleporters & Speed Boosts:** Some teleporters and speed boosts are locked behind timed addition problems that must be answered correctly before they can be used.
- **Penalty for Mistakes:** Incorrect answers impose a short delay before retrying, making quick math skills advantageous!

## Winning the Game
The game ends when the timer reaches zero. The player with the most Fame Points at that moment is declared the winner!

## Why This Game?
We created this project as part of our Java coursework, aiming to combine an engaging multiplayer experience with an educational component. By integrating simple addition into key mechanics, we ensure that learning remains a natural part of the game without disrupting the fun.

Get ready to race, outmaneuver, and outthink your opponent in **The Game of Fame**!
